      "First 2 chunks: ['LAGOS ST A TE GOVERNMENT P UBLIC  SERVICE  RULES   \\nREVISED TO 1st JANUAR Y , \\nLagos State Gove rnment Public Service Rules For eword FOREWORD  \\nIt seems trite to contend that there is nothing that somewhat  mirrors the image, \\nperception and indeed the effectiveness  of any Government li ke the image, \\nperception and ef fectiveness of its Public Service. I have heard people refer to the \\nword \"bureaucracy\" as if it was itself a bad thing. Checking up on the meaning of \\nthe word confirms what I already knew . It refers to a body of rules, procedures and \\nprocesses by which things are done. In my opinion , this is a good thing. A  \\nlar ge workforce like the Lagos State Public Service, inclusive of its Local \\nGovernment employees, numerous Parastatals and Commissions comprising over \\none hundred thousand people, employed to relate with members of the public, \\nprovide services and solve problems, require Rules of Engagement.  \\nWithout  clear processes, rules and procedures, their conduct within and with \\nmembers of the public would be simpl y chaotic. The \"bureaucracy\", the rules, \\nprocesses and procedures for the conduct of Public Service are contained in the \\n\"Public  \\nService Rules\" and this is a good thing. What needs to be borne in mind is that \\nsociety is evolving daily , people are changing , their needs are changing, and \\ntechnology is also having a huge impact on how things are being done. It is when \\nthe rules  \\ndo not catch up with these changes that difficulties  may arise and ﬁbureaucracyﬂ \\nmay become counter -productive . Since the return of democratic governance , a lot \\nof reforms have taken place in Lagos State, making the Lagos State Public Service \\nthe pac k leader in developmental initiatives. Unfortunately , the existing Civil \\nService Rules were  last reviewed in Between then and now , reforms in Pension Administration, application of technology , adoption of Oracle software and \\nbusiness processes, unique Id entity Numbers for Public officers, extension of \\nMaternity Leave for female officers  \\nfrom  \\nmonths to  \\nmonths with full pay , and the introduction of Paternity Leave for male officers  has \\ntaken place. Service Charters and Mission Statements have now becom e part of the \\noperational ethos of Ministries, Departments and Agencies of the Lagos State \\nGovernment.  \\nI have had cause to utilize Executive Orders or cause the issuance of Circulars to \\nbring these developments in conformity with the existing Rules. In the  \\ncircumstances, the necessity to revise the existing Rules becomes compelling. The \\nnew Public Service Rules  \\nis the outcome of the initiative to bring our bureaucracy in conformity with changing \\nlocal and global trends. The change of nomenclature from \"Civi l Service Rulesﬂ  \\nto ﬁPublicﬂ Service Rules is an attempt to make the rules applicable to Parastatals,  \\nCommissions  \\nand other Agencies of Government that have hitherto not been considered part of \\nthe main Civil Service; because Ministries, Departments and Ag encies of \\nGovernment are inter - connected and inter-dependent , it is important  \\n(i) \\nthat \\nthey all operate by a uniform set of processes and procedures in Human Resource \\nManagement. The road to these new Rules is somewhat long. It started with the tenure o f Y Yakub  Abiodun Balogun as Head of Service, continued during the \\ntenures of Adesegun Ogunlewe and Josephine Oluseyi W Williams  as Heads of \\nService and we reached  a glorious completion during the tenure of  \\nFolashade  \\nJaji as Head of Service. I am grateful to a ll of them, the Office  of Establishments \\nand Training  (the custodian), their staff, members of various Committees who \\ncontributed selflessly to the evolution of these new Rules and the State Executive \\nCouncil members who debated and passed the motion fo r adoption and \\nimplementation. I can only now commend the new Rules to the entire Public \\nServants  \\nin the hope that they will improve the service delivery capacity of the Lagos State \\nPublic Service.  \\n(Sgd) Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN) Governor of Lagos State , Governor\\'s Office, \\nIkeja. (ii) Lagos State Government Public Service Rules For word  \\n(iii) Preamble  PREAMBLE This document is the product of an intensive review of \\nthe rules and  \\nregulations guiding career management in the State Public Service. Without  any iota \\nof doubt, several reform programmes have been undertaken in the Lagos State \\nPublic Service since the advent of civilian rule in May  \\nand it is only logical that they be adequately accommodated in the new Public \\nService Rules. Lagos State Public Serva nts are therefore enjoined to fully acquaint \\nthemselves with these Rules, which should be applied  alongside corresponding \\nExecutive Orders, Instruments, Gazettes, Circulars and Notices as we are duty \\nbound to operate by all Laws and Proced ures guiding Public Service Management, \\nPublic Finance Management as well as Policies and Strategies in the State to ensure \\ndue diligence through transparency , accountability and probity in the conduct of Government business. Accordingly , our attention i s being drawn to the following \\nguidelines, which should be taken into account while going through these Rules: (i) \\nMethod of Numbering Each Rule has been accorded a six -digit number . The first \\ntwo indicate the Chapter; the next two, the Section; and the l ast two, the Rule \\nNumber . (e.g.  is the First Rule in the second Section of the thirteenth Chapter or \\nRule One, Section Two of Chapter Thirteen.) (ii) Arrangement of Chapters, Sections \\nand Rules There are eighteen Chapters arranged as listed in the Table  of Contents \\n(iii) Amendments Amendments to these Rules shall be effected  through Circulars, \\nwhich will be issued from time to time. (iv) Review of the Public Service Rules This \\ntreatise shall be reviewed periodically to update the provisions of the Rules . These  \\nPublic Service Rules should be widely circulated and made available to all \\ncategories of Public Servants in Lagos State as they are required  to familiarize \\nthemselves with its contents.  \\n (Sgd)  \\n‚Shade Jaji (Mrs.) Head of Service, Of fice of the Head of  Service, The Secretariat, \\nAlausa, Ikeja.  \\nLagos  \\nS t a t e  \\nG o v e r n m e n t  \\nP u b l i c  \\nS e r v i c e  \\nR u l e s  \\n(iv) T ABLE OF CONTENTS Foreword . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . iii Preamble . . . . . . . \\n. . . . . . . iii Index . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . vi -xxiv Chapter  Subject  \\nPage Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \\nAppointments and Exit from the Service . . . . . . . .  \\nActing Appointments . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \\nDiscipline . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \\nSalaries and Increments . . .  . . . . . . . . .  \\nStaff  Performance Evaluation . . . . . . . . . .  \\nPrescribed Examinations for Confirmation/Promotion. . . . . .  \\nMedical / Dental T reatment and Procedures . . . . . .  \\nCompensation, Insurance Scheme and Personal Ef fects . . . .  \\nL a g o s  \\nS t a t e  \\nG o v e r n m e n t  \\nP u b l i c  \\nS e r v i c e  \\nR u l e s Contents  \\n(v) Grievances and Petitions / Appeals . . . . . . . . . .  \\nOccupation of Government Quarters . . . . . . . . . .  \\nLeave ... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  \\nFree T ransport Facilitie s within Government ... . . . . . .

The grant of an increment may be deferred or withheld in \\naccordance with the provisions of the Chapter on Discipline.  \\nIn deciding w hich penalty to impose or recommend, a Permanent Secretary/Head of \\nExtra -Ministerial Department shall take into account the gravity of the shortcoming \\nand the quality of the of ficer\\'s previous service, bearing in mind that to withhold an \\nincrement is a mo re serious penalty than to defer it. An of ficer\\'s increment is \\ndeferred when the decision as to whether or not it shall be granted is postponed for \\na specific period.  \\nThe period must be fixed at the time the increment is deferred and must not be less \\nthan three months nor more than six months; if less than six months in the first \\ninstance, it may , if necessary , be increased to six months by an additional specific \\ndeferment. If a deferred increment is eventually granted, it does not become ef \\nfective unti l the day following the expiration of the specific period of deferment, but \\nthe recipient retains his original incremental date for subsequent increments.  If a deferred increment is not granted at or before the expiration of six months from \\nthe date it was  originally due, it must be withheld. An of ficer\\'s increment is withheld \\nwhen it is decided not to grant it and he shall cease to be eligible until his next \\nincremental date. The withholding of an increment thus results in the salary of the \\nof ficer in qu estion remaining for the rest of his incremental service one increment \\nbehind what it would have been had the increment not been withheld. An increment \\ndeferred or withheld cannot be restored with a retrospective ef fect in consequence \\nof improved service during a later increment -earning period.  \\nLagos State Government Public Service Rules Chapter  \\nIncr ements not as of right Incr emental Date Gr ounds for withholding  \\nor deferring Deferr ed Incr ement W ithheld Incr ement W ithheld  or deferr ed incr \\nement no t r estorable  \\nAn Of ficer who is required to fulfill any of the following conditions - (a) securing \\nconfirmation of appointment (b) passing of a prescribed examination or test may , \\nif the conditions are not fulfilled within the specific time, cease to be e ligible to \\nreceive any increment until the date on which he does fulfil the conditions in \\nquestion.  \\nLagos State Government Public Service Rules  \\nChapter  \\nSuspending of Incr ements  \\nCHAPTER  \\nST AFF PERFORMANCE EV ALUA TION SECTION  \\n- GENERAL SECTION  \\n- PROGRESS R EPOR TS ON OFFICERS SECTION  - R E N D I T I O N  \\nO F \\nS T A F F  \\nP E R F O R M A N C E  \\nAPPRAISAL  \\nREPOR TS  \\nSECTION  \\n- GENERAL It is required that both the reporting of ficer and the of ficer being \\nreported on, at the beginning of the reporting period must agree  on p e r f o r m a n \\nc e \\ng o a l s  \\nd e r i v a b l e  \\nf r o m  \\nt h e \\no v e r a l l  \\nw o r k  \\np l a n  \\no f \\nt h e \\nMinistry/Department/Agency for the reporting period.
